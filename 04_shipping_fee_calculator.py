# Calculate shipping charges for a shopper. Ask the user to enter the amount for their total purchase.
# If their total is under $50, add $10. Otherwise, shipping is free.
# Tell the user their final total including shipping costs and format the number so it looks like a monetary value.
# Donâ€™t forget to test your solution with:
# A value > 50
# A value < 50
# A value of exactly 50
