#Calculate shipping charges for a shopper. Ask the user to enter the amount for their total purchase.
#If their total is under $50, add $10. Otherwise, shipping is free.
#Tell the user their final total including shipping costs and format the number so it looks like a monetary value.
#Donâ€™t forget to test your solution with:
#A value > 50
#A value < 50
#A value of exactly 50
